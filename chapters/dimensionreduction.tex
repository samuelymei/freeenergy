For human beings, it is difficult to interpret high dimensional data. It is usually essential to identify slowly varying order parameters, also known as collective variables (CVs), out from a complex system in physical chemistry. For processes with a huge number of time scales, it is usually accepted that the CVs should capture the slow dynamics of rare events embedded in a wide of spectrum of fast events. However, it is a challenging task, and we normally resort to intuition.
