Natural data is often represented in high-dimensional spaces, leading to the ``curse of dimensionality'' challenge in analysis. This complexity makes it difficult for humans to visualize and interpret such data. However, the generation of these data usually occurs within a limited number of degrees of freedom. Identifying slowly varying order parameters, or collective variables (CVs), is crucial in the field of physical chemistry, especially for complex systems. These CVs are typically expected to exist on a low-dimensional manifold, capturing the slow dynamics of rare events amid a range of faster occurrences. Identifying effective CVs is challenging, often relying on intuition. According to Peters\cite{PetersARPC2016}, an ideal CV should meet three criteria: (i) it should be a function of the instantaneous configuration space, excluding velocities; (ii) its value should change monotonically between two states, with corresponding isosurfaces creating non-intersecting dividing surfaces in the configuration space; (iii) it allows for projecting a free energy profile along it, ensuring that the reduced dynamics along the CV are consistent with those in the full phase space.

For a brief introduction to the modern dimension reduction methods or manifold learning methods, please refer to Ref.~\cite{IzamanWIREsCS2012}. Specially, the generic problem addressed by dimension reduction, or manifold learning, is as follows: given a set of $k$ observations $\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_k$ in $\mathbb{R}^D$, find a set of points $\mathbf{y}_1,\dots,\mathbf{y}_k$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\ll D$) that serve as the best representation of $\mathbf{x}_i$. Most dimensionality reduction algorithms fit into either one of two broad categories: Matrix factorization (such as PCA) or Graph layout (such as t-SNE and UMAP).
